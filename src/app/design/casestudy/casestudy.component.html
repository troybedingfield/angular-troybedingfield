            <h3>The Challenge?</h3>
            <p>The company leadership approached our team and asked us to rethink and overhaul our mobile app based on
                app store download and usage analytics to drive new downloads, improve engagment, and make it easier to
                use. </p>

                    <h5>Main Menu and Page Organization</h5>
                    <p>Our mobile app was originally built to match the minimally responsive web pages with all of the
                        pages and products listed in the menu causing a very long and overwhelming experience for users
                        to find what they need and make sense of where they need to go to access desired workflows. </p>
                    <p>We started by looking at analytics and user feedback on the most commonly used pages and
                        functions and put pages into content type buckets so we coul rethink the menu and product pieces
                        that the users cared about.</p>
                    <p>This also lead to us taking the mobile app and looking at keeping consistentcy with out brand
                        and web app so that it doesn't feel like a different product but also update the functionality
                        and design for a true mobile app experience.</p>

                        made it persistent, and identified 5 section categories our products and pages fit into.</p>
                    <p class="white">We created a submenu based on our pill button from the web app that would allow us
                        to filter our pages within each section and tabs within the page content to break content into
                        smaller sections to minimize vertical swiping.</p>

            efficiently </p>

            <h3>The Prototype</h3>
            <p>We created a high fidelity prototype to share with the internal stakeholders and from the positive
                response and feedback the company stakeholder asked the mobile development to create a functional
                prototype to beta test with companies and for a conference</p>

        <h3>The Result</h3>
        <p>The internal stakeholders and product managers have been pleased with the updates and are beta testing with
            compaines and gathering data and relaying feedback as needed to both the UX and Development so we can
            quickly turn around updates for further testing. The ease of use and paring down of pages and sections has
            been a welcome change and the feedback has been this actually feels like a useful mobile application and not
            a poor clone of the responsive mobile web app</p>
